Description: The diversity of species combinations observable in sampling units
  reflects a speciesâ€™ uneven distribution and preference for specific abiotic
  and biotic conditions. This package uses grid or transect data sets to measure
  the number of realized species combinations and the Shannon diversity of 
  realized species combinations as a function of spatial scale. Classical
  Shannon diversity measures biodiversity based on the number and relative
  abundance of species, whereas the specific version of Shannon diversity
  presented here characterizes biodiversity and provides information on species
  coexistence relationships.
