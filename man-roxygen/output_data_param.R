##' @param data A matrix or data frame capturing the spatial coordinate(s) of
##' species sampled from a grid or transect. Each row captures the coordinate(s)
##' of a `Species`. If the `data` was sampled as a Transect only the `X`
##' coordinate is required.  If the `data` was sampled as a Grid both `X` and
##' `Y` coordinates are required.
